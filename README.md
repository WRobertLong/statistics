# Rust Statistics Library

A personal project building a statistics and linear algebra library from scratch in Rust.

**Note:** This project is primarily an educational exercise to cement understanding of Rust's ownership model, type system, and trait implementation. It is written by a statistician exploring systems programming.

## 🎯 Goals

* Implement core linear algebra structures (Vectors, Matrices) without relying on heavy external crates like `ndarray`.
* Build statistical models from first principles (OLS, eventually Mixed Effects Models).
* Focus on accuracy and understanding memory management.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Running the Project
To compile and run the current playground (main.rs):

```bash
cargo run
